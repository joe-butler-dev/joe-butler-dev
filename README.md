## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Joe!

I'm a developer currently working at [Xero][xero]. I like learning new technologies and building awesome apps.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on

  - [Commander][commander] - A simple API to store and retrieve CLI commands. I'm building this to become more familiar with .NET Core and C#
<!-- - [CatchUp][catchup] - an app for organising, finding and attending social events. I'm using this to help build my skills in ASP.NET Core, C# and TypeScript -->
<!-- - [Allocredit][allocredit] - an app that allows Xero users to allocate credit notes to their AR invoices in bulk -->
