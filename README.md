### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Joe!

I'm a developer currently working at [Xero][xero]. I like learning new technologies and building awesome apps. At the moment I'm upskilling in .NET/C# and AWS.

**ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on:**

  - [Commander][commander] - A simple .NET API to store and retrieve CLI commands
  - [Jinxiobot][jinxiobot] - A Slack bot made using Node.js and Botkit
<!-- - [CatchUp][catchup] - an app for organising, finding and attending social events. I'm using this to help build my skills in ASP.NET Core, C# and TypeScript -->
<!-- - [Allocredit][allocredit] - an app that allows Xero users to allocate credit notes to their AR invoices in bulk -->
