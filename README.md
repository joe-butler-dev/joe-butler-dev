## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Joe!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...

- [Pantree](https://github.com/kotare-2020/Pantree "Pantree") - a simple meal planner with a focus on sustainability. This was my final group project at Dev Academy, and my team have decided to continue working on it for practice (and because it's an awesome app!)
- [Allocredit](https://github.com/joe-butler-dev/allocredit "Allocredit") - an app that allows Xero users to allocate credit notes to their AR invoices in bulk. I'm building this to get familiar with both C# and interacting with Xero's API.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

- C#
